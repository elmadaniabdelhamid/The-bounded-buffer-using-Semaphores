## Overview

This project demonstrates the classic Producer-Consumer problem using Java.
The Producer-Consumer problem is a synchronization problem that involves ensuring that producers (who produce data and add it to a buffer)
and consumers (who take data from the buffer) operate without running into race conditions.
This project uses Java's synchronized methods. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) to simulate the production and consumption of products.

## Features

- **Producers** can add data to the buffer while there is an empty scpace .
- **Consumers** can consume data from the buffer if they exist.
- The GUI allows users to:
  - Add new producer.
  - Add new consumer.
  - Remove a producer.
  - Remove a consumer.
  - Update the buffer size.
  - View the number of producer and consumer existe.

## Installation and Setup

### Cloning the Repository

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/producer-consumer-java.git
   cd producer-consumer-java
   ```
### install JDK
```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install default-jdk
   ```

### Compiling the Project

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd producer-consumer-java
   ```

2. Compile the project:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

### Running the Project

1. Run the project:

   ```bash
   make run
   ```
### Cleanin the project
 ```bash
   make clean
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Buffer Full or Empty**:
   - If the buffer is full, producing a new data will fail, and a message will be displayed.
   - If the buffer is empty, consuming a data will fail, and a message will be displayed.
